# Portifolio

This project is a portfolio I made to present a little about myself.

In this project we use the following technologies:

## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications where you need a fast and interactive user experience. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, manage the state of applications, and efficiently update the user interface when data changes. React was developed by Facebook and is maintained by them along with a community of individual developers and companies. Its component-based architecture promotes modularity and helps in organizing code for better maintainability.

## JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.

And I also used the react-icons and styled components libraries.
